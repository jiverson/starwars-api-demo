# starwars-api-demo

This project was generated with [CRA](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.1.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/dist` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Notes

* `fetch` api is somewhat wonky with rxjs consider using built in ajax
* redux-observable needs some tutorials wait for egghead.io
* jest is fine no real issues since it uses jasmine expectations would like to research the benefits
